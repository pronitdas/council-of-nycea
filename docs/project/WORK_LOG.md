# UAIP Work Log

## 2025-06-28 – Core Agent Flow Stabilisation

### Completed
- Implemented **Agent State Machine** with strict transition rules and EventBus hooks  
  Path: `backend/shared/services/src/agent-state/agent-state-machine.ts`
- Added **Capability Resolver** for dynamic tool lookup and validation  
  Path: `backend/shared/services/src/agent-intelligence/capability-resolver.ts`
- Integrated **Decision Engine** with performance timing and state transition control  
  Path: `backend/shared/services/src/agent-intelligence/decision-engine.ts`
- Implemented **Memory Commit Hook** for automatic short-term memory persistence  
  Path: `backend/shared/services/src/agent-memory/memory-commit-hook.ts`
- Delivered **Collaboration Pattern Runner** supporting sequential / parallel / hierarchical flows  
  Path: `backend/shared/services/src/collaboration/collaboration-pattern-runner.ts`
- Added **Workflow Persistence Service** for step status tracking and metrics  
  Path: `backend/shared/services/src/collaboration/workflow-persistence.service.ts`
- Introduced **Agent Event Bus** for unified observability and performance metrics  
  Path: `backend/shared/services/src/observability/agent-event-bus.ts`
- Extended **Type Definitions** for new agent states, collaboration patterns, and message routing  
  Path: `packages/shared-types/src/agent.ts`

### Outcomes
- End-to-end agent loop now stable: `idle → thinking → executing → waiting/error → idle`.
- Real-time collaboration between agents functional with full event telemetry.
- Performance metrics captured for decisions, tool executions, and workflows.
- All shared and service packages compile; only cosmetic ESLint warnings remain.

### Next Phases (Sprint 2025-07-01 → 2025-07-14)
1. **Zero-Lint Pass** – Eliminate all ESLint warnings & add `npm run lint` to CI.
2. **CI "Builder Service" Bootstrap** – GitHub Action running lint, build, tests; cache deps.
3. **Code-Generation Tool & PR Workflow** – `codeGeneration` tool, DecisionEngine action, draft PR branch.
4. **PolicyAgent Skeleton** – initial guard-rails (compile, tests, no TODOs), PR review comment.
5. **Documentation & Demo Assets** – update `AGENTS.md` diagrams; add demo GIF/logs.
