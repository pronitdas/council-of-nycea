## Knowledge Graph Integration (NEW SECTION)

## A-ui (AUTONOMOUS ULTRA INSTINCT) Assimilation

The A-ui (AUTONOMOUS ULTRA INSTINCT) initiative is now fully assimilated into the platform's roadmap and technical DNA. Rather than existing as a discrete project or feature, A-ui permeates every layer of the platform, shaping priorities, technical direction, and user experience. Its architecture, design principles, and feature set are inseparable from the ongoing evolution of the system.

### Assimilated Characteristics
- **Phased Foundation:**
  - *Phase 1: Foundation & Core UI* — Theme system, layout components, navigation, state management, API integration, and backend connectivity are now baseline expectations for all UI/UX work.
  - *Phase 2: Feature Expansion* — Interactive quiz, content management, accessibility, and UI refactoring are not add-ons but core to the platform's growth.
  - *Phase 3: Feature Completion* — UI polish, accessibility, and user experience are continuous, cross-cutting concerns.

- **Core Features (Assimilated):**
  - Customizable theme system and modular layout are now default for all new UI modules.
  - State management and unified API integration are platform standards.
  - Real-time WebSocket integration and role-based UI (RBAC) are foundational, not optional.
  - Operation dashboards, progressive disclosure, and onboarding are expected in all user-facing features.

- **AI & Knowledge Capabilities:**
  - Code assistant, knowledge base, command history, and context management are assimilated as core platform intelligence.
  - Semantic search, knowledge UI, and Qdrant vector database are part of the knowledge graph's living infrastructure.

- **Accessibility & Compliance:**
  - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is a non-negotiable, tracked at every phase and work item.
  - Accessibility risks and resource requirements are proactively managed and visible in the roadmap.

- **Design & Usability:**
  - UI/UX mockups, extensibility, and onboarding are not isolated tasks but ongoing, assimilated practices.

- **Work Items & Epics:**
  - All relevant tasks, epics, and dependencies are now modeled as part of the assimilated A-ui structure in the knowledge graph, influencing sprint planning and milestone definitions.

### Roadmap Impact
- All future frontend and knowledge graph work is now guided by the assimilated A-ui principles.
- Technical priorities, success metrics, and risk management strategies reflect A-ui's influence.
- The platform's evolution is inseparable from the ongoing assimilation of A-ui's architecture and philosophy.
