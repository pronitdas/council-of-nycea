# Tardis Knowledge Commons: The Geronimo Strategy

## üéØ Executive Vision

**"Time Travel Through Knowledge - Un-Gatekeeping AI for Every Developer"**

Tardis transforms the Universal Program into the world's first **sustainable AI knowledge commons**. By offering **25 free AI queries per day forever**, we democratize access to artificial intelligence while building a self-reinforcing ecosystem where knowledge caching creates increasing returns to scale.

## üß† The Knowledge Commons Model

### Core Philosophy: "Leave the Code Better Than You Found It"
Every query enriches the collective knowledge graph. Every answer improves for the next developer. Every contribution makes the platform more valuable for everyone.

### Network Effects Engine
```
More Users ‚Üí More Queries ‚Üí Better Knowledge Graph ‚Üí Higher Cache Hit Rates ‚Üí Lower Costs ‚Üí More Free Access ‚Üí More Users
```

This virtuous cycle creates a sustainable moat that becomes stronger with scale, not weaker.

## üí∞ Revolutionary Economics

### Unit Economics That Scale
```
Base Cost: $0.50/user/month (25 queries √ó $0.02 OpenRouter cost)
60% Cache Hit Rate: $0.20/user/month
80% Cache Hit Rate: $0.10/user/month (at scale)
Break-even: 18% conversion rate
Target: 25% conversion rate
```

### The Magic of Knowledge Caching
- **Semantic Similarity**: Vector embeddings identify similar queries
- **Community Improvement**: Answers evolve and improve over time
- **Attribution System**: Contributors get recognition and reputation
- **Quality Assurance**: Community voting and expert validation

All core components have been implemented, tested, and verified as production-ready:

#### Knowledge Graph Infrastructure
- **‚úÖ KnowledgeGraphService**: Core service managing knowledge storage, retrieval, and relationships
- **‚úÖ Vector Database (Qdrant)**: Operational with 4 collections, 768-1024 dimensional embeddings
- **‚úÖ PostgreSQL Storage**: Configured with TypeORM entities for structured knowledge storage
- **‚úÖ TEI Embedding Service**: Running `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1` model, generating 1024-dimensional vectors
- **‚úÖ Redis Cache**: Active for session management and caching
- **‚úÖ Content Classification**: Automatic categorization into 6 knowledge types (CONCEPTUAL, PROCEDURAL, EXPERIENTIAL, EPISODIC, SEMANTIC, FACTUAL)
- **‚úÖ Relationship Detection**: Advanced relationship discovery between knowledge items

#### Three-Layered Knowledge Architecture ‚úÖ
```typescript
interface KnowledgeScope {
  userId?: string;    // User-specific knowledge layer
  agentId?: string;   // Agent-specific knowledge layer
  // When both null = General knowledge commons
}
```

**Implementation Details:**
- **General Knowledge**: Community-wide knowledge accessible to all users
- **Agent Knowledge**: AI agent-specific learnings and capabilities
- **User Knowledge**: Personal knowledge and preferences per user
- **Scoped Search**: All queries respect knowledge layer boundaries
- **Attribution System**: Track contributions across all knowledge layers

#### Advanced Semantic Search ‚úÖ
```typescript
interface KnowledgeSearchRequest {
  query: string;
  filters?: {
    types?: KnowledgeType[];
    tags?: string[];
    confidence?: number;
    sourceTypes?: SourceType[];
  };
  options?: {
    limit?: number;
    similarityThreshold?: number;
    includeRelationships?: boolean;
  };
  scope?: KnowledgeScope;  // Three-layered architecture
}
```

**Capabilities Verified:**
- **Semantic Similarity**: Vector embeddings identify similar queries with 60-80% cache hit potential
- **Multi-Type Search**: Search across CONCEPTUAL, PROCEDURAL, EXPERIENTIAL knowledge types
- **Confidence Scoring**: Quality assurance through community validation
- **Relationship Enhancement**: Knowledge items connected through detected relationships

#### Knowledge Caching System ‚úÖ
```typescript
interface KnowledgeItem {

  tags: string[];
  confidence: number;
  userId?: string;      // Three-layered architecture
  agentId?: string;     // Three-layered architecture
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;      // Time travel support
}
```

**Cache Strategy:**
- **Vector-First**: Check semantic similarity in Qdrant before external API calls
- **Community Improvement**: Answers evolve and improve over time through contributions
- **Attribution Tracking**: Contributors get recognition and reputation scoring
- **Quality Assurance**: Community voting and expert validation systems ready

    const cached = await this.knowledgeService.search({
      query: prompt,
      scope,
      options: { similarityThreshold: 0.8 }
    });
    
    if (cached.items.length > 0) {
      return this.enhanceWithKnowledgeCache(cached.items[0]);
    }
    
    // 2. Query OpenRouter if cache miss
    const response = await this.openRouter.query(prompt);
    
    // 3. Cache the response for future community use
    await this.knowledgeService.ingest([{
      content: response.content,
      source: { type: SourceType.EXTERNAL_API, identifier: 'openrouter' },
      scope,
      confidence: response.confidence || 0.7
    }]);
    
    return response;
  }
}
```
