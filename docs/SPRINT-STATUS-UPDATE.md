   - Basic code search interface
   - Integration with existing React frontend
   - Search result display with syntax highlighting

#### Week 2: Enhanced Code Features
1. **Code Assistant Features**
   - Context-aware code suggestions
   - Basic error detection integration
   - Code completion API

2. **Code Navigation**
   - Symbol navigation implementation
   - Basic call hierarchy
   - Integration with existing UI

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Code search performance tuning
   - Caching implementation
   - Load testing

#### SUCCESS CRITERIA

## Updated Backlog Priority

### High Priority (Next 2 Sprints)
1. **Sprint 4.1**: Complete Knowledge Foundation essentials
2. **Sprint 5**: Code Intelligence Foundation
3. **Frontend Integration**: Complete remaining 20% of frontend-backend integration

### Medium Priority (Future Sprints)
1. **Advanced Data Connectors**: Git repository integration, file system connectors
2. **Advanced Vector Search**: Hybrid search, advanced ranking algorithms
3. **Context Management**: Workspace context tracking and management

### Low Priority (Deferred)
1. **Enterprise Integrations**: Confluence, JIRA, SSO
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Usage insights, optimization recommendations
3. **Mobile Support**: Mobile-optimized interfaces

## Team Assignments

### Sprint 4.1 (This Week)
- **Backend Team**: Database schema completion, basic vector setup
- **Integration Team**: Knowledge service API integration
- **Frontend Team**: Prepare for code intelligence UI components

### Sprint 5 (Next 2 Weeks)
- **AI Team**: Code embeddings and semantic search
- **Backend Team**: Code analysis services and APIs
- **Frontend Team**: Code intelligence UI components
- **Full Stack Team**: End-to-end integration testing

## Risk Mitigation

### Current Risks
1. **Vector Database Complexity**: Mitigate by starting with simple implementation
2. **Code Intelligence Accuracy**: Mitigate by focusing on basic features first
3. **Integration Complexity**: Mitigate by leveraging existing UAIP infrastructure

### Contingency Plans
- If vector database proves complex, implement basic keyword search first
- If code intelligence is too complex, focus on basic file search and navigation
- If integration issues arise, implement as standalone service initially

---

**Status**: Sprint 4.1 ACTIVE (Knowledge Foundation Completion)
**Next Sprint**: Sprint 5 (Code Intelligence Foundation)
**Overall Progress**: 70% backend infrastructure, 30% knowledge features, 0% code intelligence
**Timeline**: Sprint 4.1 (1 week) + Sprint 5 (2 weeks) = 3 weeks to core functionality
