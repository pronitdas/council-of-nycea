# UAIP Knowledge Graph – Implementation Progress & Task Checklist

> **Goal:** Complete three-layered Knowledge Graph (General, User, Agent) fully wired end-to-end in both the database and the service layer, with routes exposed through the Security Gateway and frontend integration.

---

## 📋 Phase 1 – Data-Model & Storage (PostgreSQL + Qdrant)

- [x] **Add columns to entities** ✅ COMPLETED  
  • File: `shared/services/src/entities/knowledge-item.entity.ts`  
  • File: `shared/services/src/entities/knowledge-relationship.entity.ts`  
  ∘ `userId?: string` *(nullable)*  
  ∘ `agentId?: string` *(nullable)*  
  ∘ `summary?: string` *(nullable)*
- [x] **Create TypeORM migration** ✅ COMPLETED  
  `025-add-ownership-and-summary-columns.ts` and `026-backfill-agent-knowledge-items.ts`
- [x] **Back-fill existing rows** ✅ COMPLETED  
  Migration script sets `agentId` on legacy agent-memory items; keeps others `NULL`.
- [x] **Indexing** ✅ COMPLETED  
  Added compound indexes `(userId, type)` and `(agentId, type)` in migration 027.
- [ ] **Qdrant payload schema**  
  POST `/collections/knowledge/payload_index` for `userId` and `agentId`.

---

## 📋 Phase 2 – Core Service Refactor

- [x] **Define `KnowledgeScope` type** ✅ COMPLETED in `@uaip/types`.
- [x] **Refactor `KnowledgeGraphService`** ✅ COMPLETED  
  ∘ All public methods accept `scope: KnowledgeScope`.  
  ∘ Inject scope into Postgres queries & Qdrant filters.
- [x] **Update `KnowledgeRepository` queries** ✅ COMPLETED to respect `scope` in WHERE clauses.
- [ ] **Consolidate `AgentMemoryService`**  
  Remove direct DB logic → call `KnowledgeGraphService` with `{ agentId }`.
- [x] **Implement `UserKnowledgeService`** ✅ COMPLETED  
  Wrapper around `KnowledgeGraphService` that always passes `{ userId }`.

---

## 📋 Phase 3 – Security Gateway API

- [x] **Add routes** ✅ COMPLETED in `services/security-gateway/src/routes/knowledgeRoutes.ts`:
  ```text
  POST   /v1/knowledge            -> add user knowledge
  GET    /v1/knowledge/search     -> search user knowledge  
  GET    /v1/knowledge/tags/:tag  -> get knowledge by tag
  GET    /v1/knowledge/stats      -> get user knowledge stats
  PATCH  /v1/knowledge/:itemId    -> update user knowledge
  DELETE /v1/knowledge/:itemId    -> delete user knowledge
  GET    /v1/knowledge/:itemId/related -> get related knowledge
  ```
- [x] **Middleware** ✅ COMPLETED – JWT `sub` → `req.user.id`; proper auth validation.
- [x] **Service Dependency Injection** ✅ COMPLETED  
  Implemented `ServiceFactory` and `ServiceInitializer` for proper DI.

---

## 📋 Phase 4 – Context Orchestration

- [x] **Create `ContextOrchestrationService`** ✅ COMPLETED  
  ∘ Query order: `{ agentId }` ➜ `{ userId }` ➜ `{}` (general)  
  ∘ Rank & merge, cut to `MAX_TOKENS`.
- [ ] **Integrate into `agent-intelligence` controllers** instead of direct memory calls.

---

## 📋 Phase 5 – Frontend Integration Points

- [ ] **Knowledge Management UI Components**
  ```typescript
  // React components needed:
  - KnowledgeUploader      // Drag-drop files, text input
  - KnowledgeSearch        // Search interface with filters
  - KnowledgeItemCard      // Display individual knowledge items
  - KnowledgeGraph         // Visual relationship explorer
  - KnowledgeStats         // Dashboard metrics
  ```

- [ ] **Frontend API Integration**
  ```typescript
  // API client methods:
  class KnowledgeAPI {
    async uploadKnowledge(items: KnowledgeIngestRequest[]): Promise<KnowledgeIngestResponse>
    async searchKnowledge(query: KnowledgeSearchRequest): Promise<KnowledgeSearchResponse>
    async updateKnowledge(itemId: string, updates: Partial<KnowledgeItem>): Promise<KnowledgeItem>
    async deleteKnowledge(itemId: string): Promise<void>
    async getKnowledgeStats(): Promise<KnowledgeStats>
    async getRelatedKnowledge(itemId: string): Promise<KnowledgeItem[]>
  }
  ```

- [ ] **WebSocket Integration**
  ```typescript
  // Real-time knowledge updates:
  - Knowledge ingestion progress
  - New knowledge notifications
  - Collaborative knowledge editing
  - Agent knowledge discovery events
  ```

- [ ] **Frontend Routes & Navigation**
  ```text
  /knowledge              -> Knowledge dashboard
  /knowledge/search       -> Advanced search interface
  /knowledge/upload       -> Bulk upload interface
  /knowledge/graph        -> Visual knowledge graph
  /knowledge/item/:id     -> Individual knowledge item view
  ```

- [ ] **State Management**
  ```typescript
  // Redux/Zustand stores:
  - knowledgeStore        // Current user's knowledge
  - searchStore          // Search state and results
  - uploadStore          // Upload progress and queue
  - graphStore           // Knowledge graph visualization state
  ```

---

## 📋 Phase 6 – Tests & Docs

- [ ] **Unit tests** for scoping, relationship CRUD, auth guard.
- [ ] **Integration tests** – two users, isolation verified.
- [x] **Update API docs** ✅ COMPLETED routes in knowledgeRoutes.ts with proper OpenAPI comments.
- [ ] **Frontend component tests** with React Testing Library.
- [ ] **E2E tests** with Playwright covering full knowledge workflow.

## 🔧 Current Issues & Next Steps

### ✅ RESOLVED Blockers:
1. **Service Dependency Injection** - ✅ COMPLETED
   - Created `ServiceFactory` with proper dependency injection
   - All services properly initialized with correct dependencies
   - Added `ServiceInitializer` for easy API integration

2. **Service Factory Pattern** - ✅ COMPLETED
   - Implemented centralized service initialization
   - Lazy loading with caching
   - Health check capabilities
   - Testing support with fresh instances

### Next Priority Tasks:
1. ✅ ~~Create service factory/container for dependency injection~~ COMPLETED
2. ✅ ~~Implement missing indexes for performance~~ COMPLETED  
3. Set up Qdrant payload schema for userId/agentId filtering
4. Begin frontend component development
5. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
6. Integration testing with full stack

---

## ⏰ Execution Instructions

1. ✅ ~~**Fix service dependencies**~~ – COMPLETED: ServiceFactory with proper DI
2. ✅ ~~**Add database indexes**~~ – COMPLETED: Migration 027 with performance indexes
3. **Setup Qdrant schema** – Configure payload indexing for scope filtering
4. **Frontend scaffolding** – Create base components and API integration
5. **Run tests continually**: `pnpm test --watch` in shared services
6. **Integration testing** – Verify full stack with frontend → API → database
7. **Performance testing** – Ensure knowledge search is fast with large datasets

> **Progress Status:** 
> - ✅ Database schema & migrations complete
> - ✅ Core service interfaces complete  
> - ✅ Security Gateway routes complete (TypeScript fixed)
> - ✅ Service dependency injection COMPLETED (ServiceFactory + ServiceInitializer)
> - ✅ Database performance indexes COMPLETED (Migration 027)
> - ✅ TypeScript compilation errors RESOLVED (circular dependency handling)
