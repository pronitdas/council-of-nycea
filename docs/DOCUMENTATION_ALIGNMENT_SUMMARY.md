## Alignment Achievements

### 1. Consistent Documentation Structure

All services now follow the standardized documentation template:

```
service-name/
├── README.md                 # Service overview, setup, API reference
├── CHAT_ENDPOINT_GUIDE.md    # (Agent Intelligence specific)
├── REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md # (Agent Intelligence specific)
├── TOOLS_ENHANCEMENT_PRD.md  # (Capability Registry specific)
└── capability-readme.md      # (Updated for alignment)
```

### 2. Unified API Documentation Format

Each service provides:
- **Endpoint Overview**: Method, path, authentication requirements
- **Request/Response Examples**: JSON schemas and curl examples
- **Integration Examples**: Cross-service usage patterns
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error response formats

### 3. Consistent Configuration Patterns

All services use:
- **Environment Variables**: Standardized naming and grouping
- **Service Discovery**: URLs for cross-service communication
- **Security Configuration**: JWT authentication and security levels
- **Performance Tuning**: Timeout, concurrency, and resource limits

### 4. Integration Architecture

Clear integration patterns established:

```typescript
// Discussion Orchestration ↔ Agent Intelligence
interface AgentParticipation {
  agentId: string;
  discussionId: string;
  context: DiscussionContext;
}

// Agent Intelligence ↔ Capability Registry  
interface CapabilityQuery {
  agentId: string;
  context: string;
  requiredCapabilities: string[];
}

// Discussion Orchestration ↔ Capability Registry
interface DiscussionCapabilityExecution {
  discussionId: string;
  participantId: string;
  toolId: string;
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### 5. Monitoring and Observability

Standardized across all services:
- **Health Checks**: `/health`, `/health/database`, service-specific endpoints
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Consistent naming patterns and key metrics
- **Performance Targets**: Response time and throughput specifications
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Common issues and resolution steps

## Event Runner Integration

Successfully integrated the Event Runner vision from `eventrunner.md` into the Capability Registry:

### Sandboxed Execution
- Resource constraints based on security levels
- Containerized execution environments
- Real-time monitoring and resource tracking

### Event Streaming
- WebSocket support for live execution updates
- Event-driven architecture for result processing
- Frontend-ready event streams

### Community Features
- GitHub OAuth integration for tool sharing
- Collaborative development workflows
- Automated testing and validation

## Service Boundaries & Responsibilities

| Service | Primary Responsibility | Secondary Capabilities |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Discussion Orchestration** | Real-time discussion coordination, turn management, WebSocket handling | Strategy execution, participant management |
| **Agent Intelligence** | Agent persona management, context analysis, memory systems | Chat endpoints, learning adaptation |
| **Capability Registry** | Tool/capability management, execution, discovery | Security sandboxing, usage analytics |

## Development Standards Applied

### 1. Monorepo Workspace Imports
All services properly use:
```typescript
import { Agent, Discussion } from '@uaip/types';
import { DatabaseService } from '@uaip/shared-services';
import { logger } from '@uaip/utils';
import { config } from '@uaip/config';
```

### 2. TypeScript Project References
Each service properly references shared packages in `tsconfig.json`

### 3. Consistent Error Handling
Standardized error and success response formats across all services

### 4. Security Standards
- JWT authentication middleware
- Security levels and approval workflows
- Data privacy and audit logging

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Implementation Verification (Week 1)
- [ ] Verify all services build successfully with updated configurations
- [ ] Test cross-service integration endpoints
- [ ] Validate monorepo workspace imports

### Phase 2: API Implementation (Week 2)  
- [ ] Implement missing API endpoints documented in READMEs
- [ ] Add health check endpoints to all services
- [ ] Implement Prometheus metrics collection

### Phase 3: Integration Testing (Week 3)
