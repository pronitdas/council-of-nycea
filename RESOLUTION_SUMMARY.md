# Council of Nycea - Resolution Summary

## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### 1. **TypeScript/React Linter Errors Fixed**

#### Issues Found:
- ❌ Cannot find module 'react' or its corresponding type declarations
- ❌ Cannot find module 'lucide-react' or its corresponding type declarations  
- ❌ Property 'children' is missing in type '{}' but required in type '{ children: React.ReactNode; }'
- ❌ JSX tag requires the module path 'react/jsx-runtime' to exist

#### Solutions Applied:

**1. TypeScript Configuration Updates** (`apps/frontend/tsconfig.app.json`):
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "jsxImportSource": "react",
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "typeRoots": ["./node_modules/@types", "../../node_modules/@types"]
  },
  "include": ["src", "../../node_modules/@types"]
}
```

**2. Dependencies Resolution**:
- ✅ All dependencies properly configured through PNPM catalog system
- ✅ React 19.1.0 and TypeScript 5.8.3 working correctly
- ✅ Lucide React icons properly resolved

**3. Children Props**:
- ✅ All context providers already had proper children prop definitions
- ✅ Issues were due to TypeScript configuration, not missing props

#### Result: 
- ✅ **Build successful** - No TypeScript errors
- ✅ **All linter errors resolved**
- ✅ **Development server runs without issues**
