## 4. Offloading Capabilities: Tool Registry & Artifact Service

### Tool Registry
- **Purpose:** Centralized management of tools (widgets, analytics, GIS, trading, etc.)
- **How to Use:**
  - Register tools with metadata (capabilities, required permissions, persona tags)
  - Dynamically load tools into portals based on user persona and permissions
  - Example: Analytics, map overlays, trading widgets are registered as tools and injected into relevant portals

### Artifact Service
- **Purpose:** Storage and retrieval of user-generated or system-generated artifacts (reports, maps, assessments, logs)
- **How to Use:**
  - Portals interact with the artifact service to save/load artifacts
  - Example: Assessment results, GIS exports, compliance logs, learning progress are stored/retrieved via the artifact service

### Benefits
- **Extensibility:** New tools/artifacts can be added without changing portal code
- **Modularity:** Capabilities are decoupled from UI, enabling reuse and easier updates
- **Personalization:** Tool registry can filter tools by persona, role, or capability

## 5. Example Portal Configurations (Persona-Based)

### EdTech: Educator
```typescript
export const PORTAL_CONFIGS_EDTECH_EDUCATOR = {
  dashboard: { ... },
  learningModules: { ... },
  analytics: { tools: ToolRegistry.getTools('analytics', 'edtech') },
  collaboration: { tools: ToolRegistry.getTools('collaboration', 'edtech') },
  assessment: { artifactService: true },
  systemSettings: { ... },
  marketplace: { ... }
};
```

### GIS: Analyst
```typescript
export const PORTAL_CONFIGS_GIS_ANALYST = {
  dashboard: { ... },
  mapTools: { tools: ToolRegistry.getTools('gis', 'gis') },
  analytics: { tools: ToolRegistry.getTools('analytics', 'gis') },
  collaboration: { tools: ToolRegistry.getTools('collaboration', 'gis') },
  compliance: { artifactService: true },
  systemSettings: { ... },
  marketplace: { ... }
};
```

### Finance: Trader
```typescript
export const PORTAL_CONFIGS_FINANCE_TRADER = {
  dashboard: { ... },
  tradingTools: { tools: ToolRegistry.getTools('trading', 'finance') },
  analytics: { tools: ToolRegistry.getTools('analytics', 'finance') },
  collaboration: { tools: ToolRegistry.getTools('collaboration', 'finance') },
  compliance: { artifactService: true },
  systemSettings: { ... },
  marketplace: { ... }
};
```

### Learner: Self-paced
```typescript
export const PORTAL_CONFIGS_LEARNER_SELF = {
  dashboard: { ... },
  learningModules: { ... },
  analytics: { tools: ToolRegistry.getTools('analytics', 'learner') },
  collaboration: { tools: ToolRegistry.getTools('collaboration', 'learner') },
  assessment: { artifactService: true },
  marketplace: { ... }
};
```

## 6. Implementation Plan

1. **Persona Detection:** On login, determine user persona (role, department, preferences).
2. **Dynamic Portal Config:** Load the appropriate `PORTAL_CONFIGS_*` for the user.
3. **Tool Registry Integration:** Portals dynamically load tools from the registry based on persona/capabilities.
4. **Artifact Service Integration:** Portals use the artifact service for saving/loading user/system artifacts.
5. **Extensibility:** Admins can add new tools/artifacts via registry/service without code changes.
6. **Analytics:** Track portal/tool/artifact usage for continuous improvement.

---

## 7. Future Considerations
- **Personalization:** ML-driven tool/artifact recommendations
- **Accessibility:** Ensure all tools/artifacts meet accessibility standards
- **Localization:** Support multi-language tool/artifact metadata
- **Mobile Optimization:** Ensure tools/artifacts are mobile-friendly
