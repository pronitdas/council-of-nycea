# Epic 2: Document-Based Knowledge Mapping

## Description

This epic focuses on creating a simple knowledge mapping system that processes documents from the DocumentContext to build an understanding graph of the content. Instead of complex external integrations, we will work with files that users can dump into the system and automatically generate semantic relationships, summaries, and searchable knowledge maps. The system will analyze document content, extract key concepts, create relationships between documents, and provide agents with contextual understanding based on the uploaded document corpus.

## User Stories

- **As an Agent,** I want to query the document knowledge base using natural language questions (e.g., "What documents discuss user authentication?", "Find related content about API design"), so I can ground my responses in the available document context.
- **As a Discussion Participant (Human or Agent),** I want the system to automatically suggest relevant documents and concepts based on the ongoing conversation, so that pertinent information surfaces naturally.
- **As a Document Manager,** I want to upload files to the system and have them automatically processed into the knowledge map, so that new information becomes immediately searchable and relatable.
- **As a Developer,** I want a simple API to search and retrieve document insights and relationships, so I can integrate knowledge discovery into agent reasoning and UI components.

## Potential Pitfalls

- **Document Quality Variation:** Different file formats, writing styles, and content quality can lead to inconsistent knowledge extraction.
- **Concept Extraction Accuracy:** Automatic identification of key concepts and relationships may miss nuanced connections or create false associations.
- **Knowledge Map Complexity:** As document volume grows, the relationship graph may become too complex to navigate effectively.
- **Search Relevance:** Balancing broad conceptual search with specific document content retrieval requires careful tuning.
- **Processing Performance:** Large documents or document sets may slow down the knowledge extraction pipeline.
- **Content Duplication:** Similar content across multiple documents might create redundant or conflicting knowledge entries.

## Good Practices

- **Incremental Processing:** Process new documents incrementally rather than rebuilding the entire knowledge map.
- **Content Chunking:** Break large documents into manageable sections for better concept extraction and searchability.
- **Relationship Scoring:** Weight relationships between concepts and documents based on relevance and frequency.
- **Simple UI for Knowledge Navigation:** Provide visual tools to explore document relationships and concept maps.
- **Metadata Preservation:** Maintain document source information, upload timestamps, and processing status.
- **Configurable Processing:** Allow users to adjust concept extraction sensitivity and relationship thresholds.
- **Search Result Ranking:** Combine semantic similarity with document metadata for better search results.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

- Document upload functionality integrated with DocumentContext works reliably.
- Knowledge extraction pipeline processes documents and identifies key concepts.
- Relationship mapping between documents and concepts is functional.
- Search API allows natural language queries against the knowledge base.
- Agents can successfully retrieve relevant document insights (demonstrated through integration tests).
- Basic document management UI allows viewing knowledge maps and relationships.
- Processing status and metadata are tracked for uploaded documents.
- Performance testing shows acceptable processing time for typical document sizes.

## End-to-End (E2E) Flows

1.  **Document Upload and Processing:**
    - User uploads documents through the UI or drops files into the system.
    - DocumentContext receives and stores the document content and metadata.
    - Knowledge processing pipeline analyzes document content.
    - System extracts key concepts, topics, and entities from the text.
    - Relationships between concepts and documents are identified and scored.
    - Knowledge map is updated with new nodes and connections.

2.  **Agent Knowledge Query:**
    - Agent determines need for document context based on conversation.
    - Agent formulates a natural language query (e.g., "documents about user requirements").
    - Agent calls Knowledge Search API with the query.
    - Search service finds semantically related concepts and documents.
    - System ranks results based on relevance and document metadata.
    - Relevant document excerpts and concept relationships are returned.
    - Agent incorporates retrieved knowledge into its reasoning and response.
