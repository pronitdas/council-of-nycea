# Epic 6: Agent Tool Use Framework and Integration

## Description

This epic establishes a comprehensive tool use framework that transforms the Council of Nycea agents from conversational participants into autonomous actors capable of interacting with external systems, APIs, and services. Building on the existing agent architecture defined in `agent.ts`, this epic introduces tool definitions, execution engines, security frameworks, and UI components to support sophisticated agentic workflows. The framework will support both synchronous tools (immediate API calls, calculations) and asynchronous tools (long-running processes, multi-step workflows), with robust error handling, permission management, and observability. This positions the platform for true agentic startup capabilities where agents can perform real work beyond discussion.

## User Stories

- **As an Agent,** I want to access a curated toolkit of functions (API calls, code execution, file operations, web searches, database queries) that I can invoke when my reasoning determines external action is needed, so I can provide actionable solutions rather than just discussion.

- **As a Persona Designer,** I want to define tool permissions and preferences for each agent persona (e.g., a DevOps agent has access to deployment tools, a Research agent has access to academic databases), so agents behave consistently with their defined roles and expertise.

- **As a Discussion Moderator,** I want to see real-time tool usage indicators, execution logs, and results in the discussion interface, so I can understand what actions agents are taking and validate their outputs.

- **As a System Administrator,** I want granular control over tool access, execution limits, cost monitoring, and security policies, so I can safely enable powerful capabilities while managing risks and expenses.

- **As a Developer,** I want a standardized tool definition format and registration system that makes it easy to add new capabilities to agents, so the platform can rapidly expand its agentic capabilities.

- **As an End User,** I want agents to seamlessly transition between discussion and action, clearly communicating their intentions and results, so I can trust and collaborate with them effectively.

  | 'knowledge-graph' | 'deployment' | 'monitoring';
```

### Enhanced Message Types
```typescript
export interface Message {
  // ... existing properties ...
  
  // Tool-related properties
  toolCalls?: ToolCall[];
  toolResults?: ToolResult[];
  requiresToolApproval?: boolean;
  toolExecutionSummary?: string;
}

export interface ToolCall {
  id: string;
  toolId: string;
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
  reasoning: string;
  confidence: number;
}

export interface ToolResult {
  callId: string;
  success: boolean;
  result?: any;
  error?: string;
  executionTime: number;
  cost?: number;
}
```

## Potential Pitfalls

- **Tool Selection Confusion**: Agents choosing inappropriate tools or failing to recognize when tools are needed

## End-to-End (E2E) Flows

1. **Agent Autonomous Tool Use:**
   - Agent identifies need for external information during discussion
   - LLM reasoning selects appropriate tool from available toolkit
   - Agent generates tool call with validated parameters
   - Tool execution engine processes request asynchronously
   - Results integrated into agent's response and displayed in UI
   - Tool usage logged for monitoring and cost tracking

2. **Multi-Tool Workflow:**
   - Agent receives complex task requiring multiple tools
   - Agent plans sequence of tool calls with dependencies
   - Tools executed in parallel where possible, sequentially where dependent
   - Intermediate results passed between tools as needed
   - Final synthesized result presented to user with execution summary

3. **Approval-Required Tool Use:**
   - Agent identifies need for high-risk tool (e.g., deployment, external API write)
   - Tool call generated and marked for approval
   - Human moderator receives approval request with context and risk assessment
   - Upon approval, tool executes with full audit trail
   - Results communicated back to agent and discussion participants

4. **Tool Failure Recovery:**
   - Agent attempts tool call that fails (API down, invalid parameters, timeout)
   - Execution engine captures error details and categorizes failure type
   - Agent receives structured error information
   - Agent reasoning determines alternative approach or graceful degradation
   - Discussion continues with explanation of limitations and alternative solutions
