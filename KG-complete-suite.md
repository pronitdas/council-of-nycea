# UAIP Knowledge Graph – Implementation Progress & Task Checklist

> **Goal:** Complete three-layered Knowledge Graph (General, User, Agent) fully wired end-to-end in both the database and the service layer, with routes exposed through the Security Gateway and frontend integration.

---

## 📋 Phase 1 – Data-Model & Storage (PostgreSQL + Qdrant)

- [x] **Add columns to entities** ✅ COMPLETED  
  • File: `shared/services/src/entities/knowledge-item.entity.ts`  
  • File: `shared/services/src/entities/knowledge-relationship.entity.ts`  
  ∘ `userId?: string` *(nullable)*  
  ∘ `agentId?: string` *(nullable)*  
  ∘ `summary?: string` *(nullable)*
- [x] **Create TypeORM migration** ✅ COMPLETED  
  `025-add-ownership-and-summary-columns.ts` and `026-backfill-agent-knowledge-items.ts`
- [x] **Back-fill existing rows** ✅ COMPLETED  
  Migration script sets `agentId` on legacy agent-memory items; keeps others `NULL`.
- [ ] **Indexing**  
  Add compound indexes `(userId, type)` and `(agentId, type)` in migration.
- [ ] **Qdrant payload schema**  
  POST `/collections/knowledge/payload_index` for `userId` and `agentId`.

---

## 📋 Phase 2 – Core Service Refactor

- [x] **Define `KnowledgeScope` type** ✅ COMPLETED in `@uaip/types`.
- [x] **Refactor `KnowledgeGraphService`** ✅ COMPLETED  
  ∘ All public methods accept `scope: KnowledgeScope`.  
  ∘ Inject scope into Postgres queries & Qdrant filters.
- [x] **Update `KnowledgeRepository` queries** ✅ COMPLETED to respect `scope` in WHERE clauses.
- [ ] **Consolidate `AgentMemoryService`**  
  Remove direct DB logic → call `KnowledgeGraphService` with `{ agentId }`.
- [x] **Implement `UserKnowledgeService`** ✅ COMPLETED  
  Wrapper around `KnowledgeGraphService` that always passes `{ userId }`.

---

## 📋 Phase 3 – Security Gateway API

- [x] **Add routes** ✅ COMPLETED in `services/security-gateway/src/routes/knowledgeRoutes.ts`:
  ```text
  POST   /v1/knowledge            -> add user knowledge
  GET    /v1/knowledge/search     -> search user knowledge  
  GET    /v1/knowledge/tags/:tag  -> get knowledge by tag
  GET    /v1/knowledge/stats      -> get user knowledge stats
  PATCH  /v1/knowledge/:itemId    -> update user knowledge
  DELETE /v1/knowledge/:itemId    -> delete user knowledge
  GET    /v1/knowledge/:itemId/related -> get related knowledge
  ```
- [x] **Middleware** ✅ COMPLETED – JWT `sub` → `req.user.id`; proper auth validation.
- [ ] **Service Dependency Injection** ⚠️ NEEDS WORK  
  Currently returns 503 errors due to missing `KnowledgeGraphService` dependencies.

---

## 📋 Phase 4 – Context Orchestration

- [x] **Create `ContextOrchestrationService`** ✅ COMPLETED  
  ∘ Query order: `{ agentId }` ➜ `{ userId }` ➜ `{}` (general)  
  ∘ Rank & merge, cut to `MAX_TOKENS`.
- [ ] **Integrate into `agent-intelligence` controllers** instead of direct memory calls.

---

## 📋 Phase 5 – Frontend Integration Points

- [x] **Knowledge Management UI Components** ✅ COMPLETED
  ```typescript
  // React components implemented:
  ✅ KnowledgePortal       // Main knowledge management interface
  ✅ KnowledgeSearch       // Search interface with filters
  ✅ KnowledgeUploader     // Drag-drop files, text input (in KnowledgePortal)
  ✅ KnowledgeItemCard     // Display individual knowledge items (in KnowledgePortal)
  ⏳ KnowledgeGraph        // Visual relationship explorer (placeholder)
  ✅ KnowledgeStats        // Dashboard metrics (in KnowledgePortal)
  ```

- [x] **Frontend API Integration** ✅ COMPLETED
  ```typescript
  // API client methods implemented in uaipAPI.knowledge:
  ✅ uploadKnowledge(items: KnowledgeIngestRequest[]): Promise<KnowledgeIngestResponse>
  ✅ searchKnowledge(query: KnowledgeSearchRequest): Promise<KnowledgeSearchResponse>
  ✅ updateKnowledge(itemId: string, updates: Partial<KnowledgeItem>): Promise<KnowledgeItem>
  ✅ deleteKnowledge(itemId: string): Promise<void>
  ✅ getKnowledgeStats(): Promise<KnowledgeStats>
  ✅ getRelatedKnowledge(itemId: string): Promise<KnowledgeItem[]>
  ✅ getKnowledgeByTag(tag: string): Promise<KnowledgeItem[]>
  ✅ getKnowledgeItem(itemId: string): Promise<KnowledgeItem>
  ```

- [ ] **WebSocket Integration** ⏳ FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
  ```typescript
  // Real-time knowledge updates (planned):
  - Knowledge ingestion progress
  - New knowledge notifications
  - Collaborative knowledge editing
  - Agent knowledge discovery events
  ```

- [x] **Frontend Routes & Navigation** ✅ COMPLETED
  ```text
  ✅ Knowledge Portal accessible via Futuristic/Portals interface
  ✅ Integrated search interface within portal
  ✅ Integrated upload interface within portal
  ✅ Individual knowledge item view within portal
  ⏳ Visual knowledge graph (placeholder implemented)
  ```

- [x] **State Management** ✅ COMPLETED
  ```typescript
  // React Context-based state management:
  ✅ KnowledgeContext      // Current user's knowledge with full CRUD operations
  ✅ Search state          // Search state and results management
  ✅ Upload state          // Upload progress and queue management
  ✅ Error handling        // Comprehensive error state management
  ✅ Integration with DocumentContext for automatic knowledge extraction
  ```

---

## 📋 Phase 6 – Tests & Docs

- [ ] **Unit tests** for scoping, relationship CRUD, auth guard.
- [ ] **Integration tests** – two users, isolation verified.
- [x] **Update API docs** ✅ COMPLETED routes in knowledgeRoutes.ts with proper OpenAPI comments.
- [ ] **Frontend component tests** with React Testing Library.
- [ ] **E2E tests** with Playwright covering full knowledge workflow.

## 🔧 Current Issues & Next Steps

### Immediate Blockers:
1. **Service Dependency Injection** - `UserKnowledgeService` needs proper initialization with:
   - `KnowledgeGraphService`
   - `QdrantService` 
   - `KnowledgeRepository`
   - `EmbeddingService`
   - `ContentClassifier`
   - `RelationshipDetector`

2. **Missing Service Factory** - Need centralized service initialization pattern

### Next Priority Tasks:
1. ✅ ~~Begin frontend component development~~ **COMPLETED**
2. Create service factory/container for dependency injection
3. Implement missing indexes for performance
4. Set up Qdrant payload schema
5. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
6. Implement visual knowledge graph component

## ⏰ Execution Instructions

1. **Fix service dependencies** – Create proper DI container for knowledge services
2. **Add database indexes** – Performance optimization for user/agent scoped queries  
3. **Frontend scaffolding** – Create base components and API integration
4. **Run tests continually**: `pnpm test --watch` in shared services
5. **Integration testing** – Verify full stack with frontend → API → database
6. **Performance testing** – Ensure knowledge search is fast with large datasets

> **Progress Status:** 
> - ✅ Database schema & migrations complete
> - ✅ Core service interfaces complete  
> - ✅ Security Gateway routes complete (TypeScript fixed)
> - ⚠️ Service dependency injection needs work
> - ✅ Frontend integration complete (Portal system, API integration, state management)
> - ❌ Comprehensive testing not complete

> **Done Criteria:** All checkboxes ticked, test suite green, frontend can successfully upload/search/manage knowledge, full three-layered context retrieval working.
