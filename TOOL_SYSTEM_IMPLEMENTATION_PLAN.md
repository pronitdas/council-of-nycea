# Tool System Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of the tool system evolution tasks, leveraging existing infrastructure and following event-driven patterns already established in the codebase.

## Architecture Principles
1. **Build on existing infrastructure** - Don't reinvent the wheel
2. **Event-driven by design** - Use RabbitMQ event bus for all inter-service communication
3. **Leverage existing patterns** - Follow established patterns from OrchestrationEngine
4. **Incremental implementation** - Each task can be deployed independently

## Task 1: Tool Execution Engine Implementation

### Current State
- ✅ StepExecutorService handles tool execution as part of operation steps
- ✅ ToolExecutor provides retry logic and approval workflows
- ✅ BaseToolExecutor has concrete implementations
- ❌ No central tool execution coordinator listening to events
- ❌ Sandbox execution handler not implemented

### Implementation Steps

#### 1.1 Create Tool Execution Coordinator Service
```typescript
// Location: backend/services/capability-registry/src/services/tool-execution-coordinator.service.ts

Key Features:
- Singleton service listening to 'tool.execute.request' events
- Routes requests to appropriate executors (standard, sandboxed, MCP, OAuth)
- Manages execution lifecycle and publishes response events
- Integrates with Redis for execution status caching
```

#### 1.2 Implement Sandbox Execution Handler
```typescript
// Location: backend/services/capability-registry/src/services/sandbox-execution.service.ts

Key Features:
- Listens to 'sandbox.execute.tool' events
- Creates isolated execution environments
- Implements resource quotas and timeouts
- Initially uses process isolation, later Docker containers
```

#### 1.3 Enhance Event Bus Integration
```typescript
// Events to implement:
- tool.execute.request
- tool.execute.response
- tool.execution.started
- tool.execution.completed
- tool.execution.failed
- sandbox.execute.tool
- sandbox.execute.response
```

## Task 2: Neo4j Integration for Tool Relationships

### Current State
- ✅ ToolGraphDatabase service exists with comprehensive methods
- ✅ Graph schema defined (Tool nodes, relationships)
- ❌ Not connected to tool execution flow
- ❌ Recommendation engine not active

### Implementation Steps

#### 2.1 Connect Graph Updates to Tool Execution
```typescript
// Location: Enhance existing ToolExecutor

- After successful execution: Update usage patterns in Neo4j
- Track agent-tool relationships
- Update tool performance metrics
- Build execution dependency graphs
```

#### 2.2 Implement Tool Recommendation Service
```typescript
// Location: backend/services/capability-registry/src/services/tool-recommendation.service.ts

Key Features:
- Real-time recommendations based on context
- Similarity-based suggestions
- Usage pattern analysis
- Performance-based ranking
```

#### 2.3 Create Graph Analytics Jobs
```typescript
// Scheduled jobs for:
- Tool relationship discovery
- Usage pattern analysis
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Cleanup of stale relationships
```

## Task 3: Redis Cache Layer Implementation

### Current State
- ✅ RedisService exists with basic operations
- ✅ Connection management implemented
- ❌ No tool-specific caching logic
- ❌ No distributed locking for tools

### Implementation Steps

#### 3.1 Implement Tool Definition Cache
```typescript
// Location: backend/services/capability-registry/src/services/tool-cache.service.ts

Key Features:
- Cache tool definitions with TTL
- Invalidation on tool updates
- Warm cache on service startup
- Multi-level caching (memory + Redis)
```

#### 3.2 Add Execution Result Caching
```typescript
// For deterministic tools:
- Cache key: toolId + parameter hash
- TTL based on tool configuration
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Size-based eviction policies
```

#### 3.3 Implement Distributed Locking
```typescript
// For exclusive tool execution:
- Redis-based distributed locks
- Lock acquisition with timeout
- Automatic lock release
- Deadlock detection
```

## Task 4: Project-Tool Integration

### Current State
- ✅ Project entity exists with settings
- ✅ allowedTools array in project settings
- ❌ Tool access control not enforced
- ❌ Project context not passed to tools

### Implementation Steps

#### 4.1 Enhance Tool Security Validation
```typescript
// Location: Enhance UnifiedToolRegistry.executeTool

- Validate project tool permissions
- Check user access to project tools
- Apply project-specific rate limits
- Track project-level usage
```

#### 4.2 Implement Project Tool Management API
```typescript
// New endpoints:
- GET /projects/:id/tools - List allowed tools
- POST /projects/:id/tools - Add tool to project
- DELETE /projects/:id/tools/:toolId - Remove tool
- GET /projects/:id/tools/usage - Tool usage analytics
```

## Task 5: Enterprise Tool Adapter Expansion

### Current State
- ✅ Base OAuth tool executor exists
- ✅ Placeholder implementations
- ❌ No actual OAuth provider integrations
- ❌ No enterprise tool connectors

### Implementation Steps

#### 5.1 Implement OAuth Provider Adapters
```typescript
// Location: backend/services/capability-registry/src/adapters/

Providers to implement:
- GitHubToolAdapter
- JiraToolAdapter  
- SlackToolAdapter
- ConfluenceToolAdapter
```

#### 5.2 Create Tool Adapter Framework
```typescript
// Base classes:
- OAuthToolAdapter (base class)
- WebhookToolAdapter (for event-driven tools)
- RESTToolAdapter (for REST APIs)
- GraphQLToolAdapter (for GraphQL APIs)
```

### Integration Tests
- Test event flow end-to-end
- Verify database updates
- Test cache invalidation

### Performance Tests
- Load test tool execution
- Measure cache hit rates
- Graph query performance

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics to Track
- Tool execution success rate
- Average execution time
- Cache hit/miss rates
- Graph query performance
- Resource usage per tool

### Dashboards
- Tool execution dashboard
- Performance analytics
- Error tracking
- Usage patterns

## Security Considerations

1. **Tool Sandboxing**
   - Process isolation initially
   - Docker containers for production
   - Resource quotas enforcement

2. **Access Control**
   - Project-based permissions
   - User role validation
   - Audit trail for all executions

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive parameters
   - Secure credential storage
   - PII detection and masking

## Rollout Strategy

1. **Feature Flags**
   - Enable features progressively
   - A/B testing for recommendations
   - Gradual rollout per project

2. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Maintain existing APIs
   - Graceful degradation
   - Migration tools for data

3. **Documentation**
   - API documentation updates
   - Developer guides
   - Migration guides

## Success Criteria

1. **Performance**
   - 90% of tool executions < 1s
   - 95% cache hit rate for definitions
   - Graph queries < 100ms

2. **Reliability**
   - 99.9% uptime for tool service
   - Zero data loss
   - Graceful failure handling

3. **Adoption**
   - 80% of agents using tools
   - 50% reduction in manual tasks
   - Positive user feedback

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Technical Risks**
   - Sandbox escape: Use Docker isolation
   - Performance degradation: Implement caching

2. **Operational Risks**
   - Service outages: Circuit breakers
   - Data corruption: Backup strategies
   - Security breaches: Regular audits

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve plan
2. Set up development environment
3. Create feature branches
