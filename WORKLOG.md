## Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Component Interface Implementation (High Priority)

  ```typescript
  enforcePermissions(userId: string, permissions: string[]): Promise<boolean>;
  createAuditEntry(type: string, data: any): Promise<void>;
  getRiskLevel(operation: Operation): Promise<'low' | 'medium' | 'high'>;
  shouldRequireApproval(operation: Operation, context: SecurityContext): Promise<boolean>;
  ```
- Add missing ExecutionOrchestrator methods:
  ```typescript
  pauseOperation(operationId: string): Promise<void>;
  resumeOperation(operationId: string): Promise<void>;
  monitorOperation(operationId: string): Promise<any>;
  ```

### 2. Error Handling Enhancement (High Priority)
- Implement retry mechanism in EventBus:
  ```typescript
  private async retryOperation<T>(
    operation: () => Promise<T>,
    maxRetries: number = 3,
    backoffMs: number = 1000
  ): Promise<T>
  ```
- Add error recovery strategies for failed operations
- Implement comprehensive error logging

### 3. Testing Infrastructure (Medium Priority)
- Create test suites for core components:
  - EventBus tests
  - SecurityGateway tests
  - CapabilityRegistry tests
  - ExecutionOrchestrator tests
- Add integration tests for component interactions
- Implement performance benchmarks

### 4. Documentation Updates (Medium Priority)
- Update API documentation with new interfaces
- Add usage examples for each component
- Create troubleshooting guide
- Document error handling patterns

### 5. Performance Optimization (Lower Priority)
- Implement event batching
- Add caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize resource usage tracking
- Add performance monitoring

## Technical Debt Status

### Resolved
- âœ… Interface export issues in uaip-interfaces.ts
- âœ… Import path inconsistencies
- âœ… Missing interface definitions

### Remaining
1. Implementation Gaps
   - Missing methods in SecurityGateway
   - Missing methods in ExecutionOrchestrator
   - Incomplete error handling

2. Testing Coverage
   - Limited unit tests
   - Missing integration tests
   - No performance benchmarks

3. Documentation
   - Outdated API documentation
   - Missing usage examples
   - Incomplete error handling documentation

## Next Sprint Planning

### Sprint 1 (Current) - Interface Completion
- Complete SecurityGateway implementation
- Complete ExecutionOrchestrator implementation
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Begin unit test implementation

### Sprint 2 (Planned) - Testing & Documentation
- Complete test suite implementation

- Add performance benchmarks
- Implement monitoring system

### Sprint 3 (Planned) - Performance & Security

- Optimize resource usage

## Notes
- Priority should be given to completing the interface implementations to ensure system stability
- Error handling should be implemented alongside new features
- All new code should include unit tests
- Documentation should be updated as features are completed
