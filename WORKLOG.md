### Epic 6: Agent Tool Use Framework Development

Created comprehensive epic for transforming Council of Nycea agents into autonomous actors capable of real-world task execution:

#### Key Deliverables:
- **Epic 6 Documentation**: Complete epic specification in `/epics/06_Agent_Tool_Use_Framework.md`
- **Enhanced Agent Types**: Extended TypeScript interfaces for tool support
- **Tool Framework Architecture**: Comprehensive design for tool execution, security, and monitoring

#### Tool Framework Features:
- **Tool Categories**: Knowledge & research, development & DevOps, communication, data analytics
- **Security Framework**: Role-based permissions, sandboxing, approval workflows
- **Execution Engine**: Asynchronous processing, parallel execution, circuit breakers
- **Cost Management**: Budget tracking, usage monitoring, optimization insights

#### Enhanced Agent Architecture:
```typescript
// Extended AgentState with tool capabilities
interface AgentState {
  availableTools: string[];
  toolPermissions: ToolPermissionSet;
  toolUsageHistory: ToolUsageRecord[];
  currentToolExecution?: ToolExecution;
  toolPreferences: ToolPreferences;
  maxConcurrentTools: number;
  toolBudget?: ToolBudget;
}

// Enhanced Message types with tool integration
interface Message {
  toolCalls?: ToolCall[];
  toolResults?: ToolResult[];
  requiresToolApproval?: boolean;
  toolExecutionSummary?: string;
}
```

#### Integration Points:
- **Epic 1 (Backend)**: Tool execution APIs and permission management
- **Epic 2 (Knowledge Graph)**: Semantic search tools
- **Epic 3 (Agent Tooling)**: Foundation capabilities
- **Epic 4 (Artifacts)**: Tool-generated deliverables
- **Epic 5 (Testing)**: Tool reliability testing

#### Success Metrics Defined:
- Tool usage adoption rate across agent personas
- Execution success rate and error recovery
- Security incident monitoring
- Cost efficiency tracking
- Performance impact assessment

### Project Documentation Updates

#### README.md Overhaul:
- Complete rewrite reflecting Council of Nycea vision and capabilities
- Added comprehensive epic roadmap with Epic 6 highlight
- Documented current architecture and agent capabilities
- Added future roadmap for agentic startup capabilities
- Enhanced getting started guide and contribution guidelines

#### Architecture Highlights:
- **Multi-persona Agent System**: Distinct roles, expertise, conversation patterns
- **Advanced Conversation Features**: Sentiment analysis, logical fallacy detection
- **Think Tokens**: Transparent reasoning with visibility controls
- **Context Management**: Document integration and conversation history

### Next Steps:
1. Implement tool definition schema and registration system
2. Develop security framework with sandboxing capabilities
3. Create tool execution engine with async processing
4. Build UI components for tool usage visualization
5. Integrate with existing agent architecture

### Fixed Agent Initialization in Discussion Manager

Fixed a critical timing issue in `useDiscussionManager.ts` where the `DiscussionManager` was being initialized before agents were properly set up:

- Replaced direct `useState` initialization of `DiscussionManager` with a `useRef` approach
- Added proper initialization sequence using `useEffect` hooks:
  1. First effect adds default agents if none exist
  2. Second effect creates `DiscussionManager` only after agents are available
- Added null checks and optional chaining for safer manager method calls
- Removed stray debugger statement
- Simplified state update logic dependencies

This change ensures that:
- Default agents are properly added before manager initialization
- Manager is only created once agents are available
- All state updates and method calls are safe even before initialization
- No unnecessary re-renders from manager recreation
