### Fixed Agent Initialization in Discussion Manager

Fixed a critical timing issue in `useDiscussionManager.ts` where the `DiscussionManager` was being initialized before agents were properly set up:

- Replaced direct `useState` initialization of `DiscussionManager` with a `useRef` approach
- Added proper initialization sequence using `useEffect` hooks:
  1. First effect adds default agents if none exist
  2. Second effect creates `DiscussionManager` only after agents are available
- Added null checks and optional chaining for safer manager method calls
- Removed stray debugger statement
- Simplified state update logic dependencies

This change ensures that:
- Default agents are properly added before manager initialization
- Manager is only created once agents are available
- All state updates and method calls are safe even before initialization
- No unnecessary re-renders from manager recreation
