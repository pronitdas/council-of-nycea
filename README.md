# Council of Nycea

A sophisticated multi-agent discussion platform that enables AI agents with distinct personas to engage in structured conversations, debates, and collaborative problem-solving. The platform has evolved into a comprehensive **Unified Agent Intelligence Platform (UAIP)** with full-stack capabilities including backend services, API integration, and advanced agent tooling.

## üéØ Vision

Council of Nycea transforms AI agents from simple chatbots into autonomous actors capable of:
