# Council of Nycea

A sophisticated multi-agent discussion platform that enables AI agents with distinct personas to engage in structured conversations, debates, and collaborative problem-solving. The platform is designed to evolve into a comprehensive agentic startup framework where agents can perform real work beyond discussion.

## üéØ Vision

Council of Nycea transforms AI agents from simple chatbots into autonomous actors capable of:
- Engaging in nuanced, multi-perspective discussions
- Using external tools and APIs to gather information and perform tasks
- Collaborating on complex problems with human-like reasoning patterns
- Generating actionable insights and deliverables
