- **Real-time Discussion Management**: WebSocket-based collaborative discussions
- **Intelligent Tool Execution**: Sandboxed capability registry with security controls
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Neo4j-powered relationship mapping and recommendations
- **Enhanced Security System**: ‚úÖ **NEW** - OAuth integration, agent-specific policies, MFA, risk assessment
- **Enterprise Security**: Complete RBAC, audit trails, and approval workflows

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Backend Services (All Operational ‚úÖ)
- **Agent Intelligence Service** (Port 3001) - Context analysis, persona management
- **Orchestration Pipeline Service** (Port 3002) - Workflow coordination, operation management
- **Capability Registry Service** (Port 3003) - Tool management, sandboxed execution
- **Security Gateway Service** (Port 3004) - ‚úÖ **Enhanced** - OAuth, agent security, MFA, risk assessment
- **Discussion Orchestration Service** (Port 3005) - Real-time collaborative discussions
- **API Gateway** (Port 8081) - Centralized routing, rate limiting, documentation

### Infrastructure (All Operational ‚úÖ)

## üß† Knowledge Graph: Agents & Orchestration

The UAIP platform uses a Neo4j-powered knowledge graph to model relationships between agents, orchestration services, tools, operations, and discussions. This enables advanced reasoning, recommendations, and workflow automation.

- **Key Entities**: Agent Intelligence, Orchestration Pipeline, Discussion Orchestration, UAIP Platform, LLM Intelligence
- **Relationships**: Service integration, workflow coordination, persona management, tool usage, and more
- **Example Patterns**: (Agent)-[:USES]->(Tool), (Agent)-[:PARTICIPATES_IN]->(Discussion), (Service)-[:INTEGRATES_WITH]->(Service)

See [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#üß†-knowledge-graph-agents--orchestration), [Service Integration](docs/SERVICE_INTEGRATION.md), and [API Reference](docs/API_REFERENCE.md) for details.
